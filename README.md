## Overview

This project explores whether population size predicts the projected RN shortage gap percentage across California. I used the 2025 Registered Nurse Shortage Areas (RNSA) dataset provided by Californiaâ€™s Department of Health Care Access and Information (HCAI) through the California Open Data Portal. I fit a simple OLS regression of `gap_pct` on `est_population`, reported the fitted relationship and model diagnostics, and discussed limitations and extensions.
